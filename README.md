## Projects
1. [Home Credit Default Risk]
   ### Overview:
   Many people face challenges securing loans due to limited or no credit history, often falling prey to untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit Group aims to enhance financial 
   inclusion by offering safe, positive borrowing experiences for the unbanked, using alternative data like telco and transactional information to assess repayment ability.
   Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower 
   their clients to be successful. The main objective of this project is to predict the binary outcome of the TARGET variable, which indicates loan default.

   ### Project Objective
   The objective of this project is to analyze the **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset and:
   1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships influencing loan defaults.
   2. Identify critical predictors for credit risk assessment.
   3. Build predictive models using machine learning techniques, including **XGBoost**, **logistic regression**, and **random forest**, to forecast default probabilities.
   4. Evaluate model performance to ensure accurate and actionable insights, enabling lenders to make informed decisions and minimize financial risk.

   ### Data Sources:
   The data is provided by Home Credit, a service dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. Predicting whether or not a client will repay a 
   loan or have difficulty is a critical business need, and Home Credit wants to unlock the full potential of their data to see what sort of machine learning/deep learning     
   models can be develop to help them in this task.

   ### Data Exploration:
   Data Exploration is a process where we analyze data to find trends, patterns, anomalies, or relationships. The goal is to understand what the data can reveal. It usually 
   starts with a broad overview and then focuses on specific details as we find interesting areas. The insights gained can be valuable on their own or help guide decisions 
   for modeling, such as selecting which features to use.
